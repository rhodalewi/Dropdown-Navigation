# Intro section with dropdown navigation solution
  This project is a simple webpage component featuring an introductory section with dropdown navigation. It includes a navigation menu that allows users to toggle between dropdown options and an introductory section with basic content or information about the webpage or service.


## Features

-  A responsive dropdown menu that toggles when clicked, providing a smooth user experience for navigating through different sections.
- The dropdown will automatically close when clicking the required link, improving usability.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
